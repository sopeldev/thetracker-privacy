        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Effective date: February 9, 2026</p>

        <p>TheTracker ("we", "the app") is a GPS tracking application. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>TheTracker collects the following data solely for app functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location data</strong> &ndash; GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude), altitude, speed, and heading. This data is collected in the foreground and in the background while you are actively recording a route.</li>
            <li><strong>Device sensor data</strong> &ndash; Compass heading from the device magnetometer, used to display the compass widget.</li>
            <li><strong>Network status</strong> &ndash; Whether the device is online or offline, used to show an offline indicator and manage offline map downloads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>All collected data is used exclusively to provide the app's core features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying your current position on the map</li>
            <li>Showing real-time speed, altitude, and compass heading</li>
            <li>Recording and saving GPS routes with statistics (distance, duration, average speed)</li>
            <li>Calculating sunrise and sunset times based on your location</li>
            <li>Downloading map tiles for offline use</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All your data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. Saved routes are persisted using on-device storage (SharedPreferences). The app does not transmit your location data or any personal information to any external server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses the following third-party service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mapbox</strong> &ndash; Used to display maps and download offline map tiles. When you view or download maps, your device communicates with Mapbox servers to fetch map tiles. This may include sending your approximate viewport area to Mapbox. Mapbox's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app does not integrate any analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or other tracking services.</p>

        <h2>5. Background Location Access</h2>
        <p>The app requests background location permission to continue recording your GPS route when the app is in the background or the screen is off. Background location access is used <strong>only</strong> during active route recording that you explicitly start. No location data is collected in the background at any other time.</p>

        <h2>6. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app requests the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fine &amp; Coarse Location</strong> &ndash; To display your position and record routes</li>
            <li><strong>Background Location</strong> &ndash; To continue route recording when the app is in the background</li>
            <li><strong>Foreground Service (Location)</strong> &ndash; To maintain GPS tracking during active recording</li>
            <li><strong>Internet &amp; Network State</strong> &ndash; To load map tiles and detect offline status</li>
            <li><strong>Wake Lock</strong> &ndash; To prevent the device from sleeping during route recording</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications</strong> &ndash; To display a notification during active route recording</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, share, transfer, or disclose your personal data or location data to any third parties. Your data stays on your device.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device. You can delete individual saved routes within the app at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all stored data completely.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The app does not require account creation or collect any identifying information.</p>

        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and no data is transmitted to external servers (other than map tile requests to Mapbox), your data is protected by your device's own security measures.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
